    Launching in November 2017, this robust online platform is designed to
    empower policymakers, researchers and other stakeholders with the climate
    data, visualizations and resources they need to gather insights on
    national and global progress on climate change.
  %p
    Climate Watch will bring together dozens of datasets for the first time
    to let users analyze and compare national climate pledges under the Paris
    Agreement, access historical GHG emissions data, discover how climate
    objectives can help achieve sustainable development goals, understand
    vulnerabilities and readiness to climate impacts, and use models to map
    new pathways to a lower-carbon future.
