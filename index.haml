    Launching in November 2017, Climate Watch brings together dozens of
    datasets for the first time to let users analyze and compare national
    climate pledges under the Paris Agreement, access historical GHG emissions
    data, discover how climate objectives can help achieve sustainable
    development goals, understand vulnerabilities and readiness to climate
    impacts, and use models to map new pathways to a lower-carbon future.
  %p
    The online platform is designed to empower policymakers, researchers, media
    and other stakeholders with the climate data, visualizations and resources
    they need to gather insights on national and global progress on climate
    change.
